# Automated Geography-Based Fixed Network Planning Tool

This tool is providing the map-based fixed network planning.

The included planning options are: 

* Topologies:
  * Point-to-Point
  * Point-to-Multipoint with one aggregation stage and with multiple
* Demands:
  * Homogeneous, i.e., only Macro Base Stations or only residetial users
  * Heterogeneous, i.e., converged (joint) planning for Macro Base Stations, residential demands and Small Cells
* Protection:
  * Not protected
  * Protected Feeder Fiber: link disjoint Shortest Path or encouraging the duct sharing
